# Puzzle Generation PRD

## Overview

- Reuse the existing Sudoku web framework to introduce a library of new puzzle variations while maintaining a consistent user experience.
- Provide configurable puzzle generation pipelines that allow content designers to define difficulty levels, board themes, and challenge rules without code changes.

## Goals

1. Offer a catalog of Sudoku variants (classic, diagonal, irregular, killer, mini) within the same application shell.
2. Enable dynamic puzzle generation and curation so the experience feels fresh on repeat visits.
3. Maintain performance parity with the current single-puzzle implementation.
4. Deliver instrumentation hooks to measure engagement and puzzle completion rates.

## Non-Goals

- Creating a competitive leaderboard or account system.
- Implementing multiplayer or cooperative puzzles.
- Adding non-Sudoku puzzle types (e.g., crosswords, Kakuro).

## Target Users & Use Cases

- **New visitors**: want a quick classic Sudoku with difficulty presets.
- **Enthusiasts**: experiment with themed or variant boards that add rules and complexity.
- **Content editors**: curate daily puzzle lineups without writing code.

## User Stories

- As a casual player, I can choose a puzzle difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard/Expert) and start immediately.
- As a returning player, I can explore alternate Sudoku rule sets with clear explanations before play begins.
- As a content editor, I can schedule specific puzzles or difficulty mixes for future dates.
- As a developer, I can plug in new rule validators and generators without modifying the play UI.

## Experience Principles

- **Consistency**: keep board layout, controls, and accessibility patterns identical across puzzle variants.
- **Clarity**: present rule changes up front and offer inline reminders when a variant is active.
- **Progression**: surface recommended next puzzles based on recent completions.

## Feature Components

1. **Puzzle Catalog View**
   - Grid/list of available puzzles with metadata (variant, difficulty, estimated time).
   - Filtering by difficulty, rule set, release date.
   - "Play Now" CTA launches the existing game screen with injected configuration.
2. **Rule Definition Layer**
   - JSON schema describing board size, regions, additional constraints (e.g., diagonals, cages).
   - Extensible validator registry mapping rule IDs to enforcement logic.
3. **Generator Service**
   - Pluggable generation strategy per variant: backtracking for classic, constraint-based for killer.
   - Ability to preload puzzles at build time or generate on-demand with caching.
4. **Content Scheduling Tools**
   - YAML/JSON manifest controlling daily puzzle rotation.
   - Simple admin stub (CLI or static form) to preview upcoming puzzles.
5. **Analytics Hooks**
   - Track puzzle loads, completion time, abandon rate.
   - Emit events to existing analytics pipeline or local storage fallback for offline play metrics.

## Technical Considerations

- Abstract current puzzle state and UI so puzzle configuration is injected via props/context.
- Normalize cell constraint evaluation to accept an array of rule functions.
- Persist puzzle definitions in `/src/puzzles/` directory with variant-specific assets.
- Ensure generator output includes seed metadata for reproducibility and debugging.
- Use worker threads (or Web Workers) for heavy generation to keep UI responsive.

## Performance & Quality

- Keep initial bundle impact under +50KB gzipped by code-splitting variant-specific logic.
- Cache generated puzzles (indexed by variant+difficulty) in local storage with expiry.
- Add unit tests for rule validators and snapshot tests for configuration parsing.

## Accessibility & Localization

- Respect existing keyboard navigation; extend to new UI elements in catalog.
- Provide textual descriptions for new rule icons.
- Support localization strings for puzzle names, descriptions, and rule explanations.

## Rollout Plan

1. Internal alpha with content team using a subset of variants.
2. Beta release gated behind feature flag for 10% of users, monitoring completion metrics.
3. Full release after addressing feedback; keep flag for quick rollback.

## Open Questions

- Should premium or seasonal puzzles be gated behind specific engagement thresholds?
- Do we need an API to share puzzle seeds externally?
- How often should on-demand generators refresh caches to balance freshness vs. performance?
